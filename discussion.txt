usv w/ rpi4 communication

Hello Ã˜ystein

As you said, i will use this medium for our doubts, to help others in the future.

To contextualize, our actual project from the course of Engineering of Systems at FEUP, is in essence a challenge demonstration that consists of complete a USV route, which coordinates are extracted automatically (a set of sea deployed floats) from a aerial drone photo. 
According to those, we have to create a plan with a set of go to messages within the imcpy and send them to the vehicle.

- Atm the extracting python tool is perfectly working and is able to output a set of coordinates. 
- We have full communication trough ssh with the vehicle, with a LAN connection PC<--->phone<--->USV , that incorporates a rpi4, as well as a functional instance of dune with all peripherals running ok.
- We were also able to test [the keyboard input example](https://github.com/oysstu/imcpy/blob/master/examples/keyboard_input_example.py) in Simulation mode, although only in a PC dune instance, and confirm inside Neptus with success. Next step will be to test in the vehicle.

So, at this point we have some conceptual doubts. 
When that example is running, does it find for it self a running dune with the indicated name at  `actor = KeyboardActor('lauv-simulator-1')` ? 
Does is whatever the received console matching input defined here

```
def on_console(self, line):
        if line == 'exit':
          ...
        elif line == 'stop':
          ...
        elif line == 'start':
         ...
```
