"""
The following example describes how to use the ActorBase class.

When derived from this class announces itself as a CCU, similar to Neptus, and can send and receive IMC messages.
The event loop is based on asyncio. Interactions with asyncio is done through the decorators.
@Subscribe adds a subscriber to a certain IMC message
@Periodic adds a function to be run periodically by the event loop.
